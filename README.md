This repo contains code for an SML (Simple Machine Language) interpreter. The SML has 7 different instructions: Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Out, Lin, Bnz. All these are subclasses of the abstract class Instructions.
This repo also contains tests for these instructions. The Machine class is the driver class and the Translator class translates the line of text into machine input. For the purposes of simplifying the testing, a text file containing the machine commands was used.
